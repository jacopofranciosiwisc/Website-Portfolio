	"about_text": "I was born in L'Aquila, a small town in Italy. When I was 7 years old, an earthquake destroyed my home and everything I had grown up around. For years, I looked for something that could fulfill my desire to be able to give back to my childhood community and start making change in the world. Now, I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. I chose technology as the tool to spearhead my efforts, constantly looking to create and work with meaningful ideas that contribute real value to the world."
