	"about_text": "When I was 7 years old, an earthquake hit my home town L'Aquila, in Abruzzo, Italy. Everything I had grown up around was gone. My family and I moved around countless times and faced hardships together, eventually moving to Chicago 8 or so years ago. Recently, I obtained my citizenship from the United States, and graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. Currently I am studying ML and AI, and restlessly learning new programming skills."
